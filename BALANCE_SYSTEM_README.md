## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Database (Already Done ✅)
```bash
# Migration ran successfully
php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2024_11_24_084000_create_user_balance_system.php

# Tables created:
# - user_balances (denormalized summary)
# - user_recharges (payment history)
# - user_balance_transactions (audit ledger)
# - balance_suspension_logs (suspension tracking)
```

### 2. Core Models (Already Done ✅)
```php
// app/Models/
UserBalance.php                  // Account balance
UserRecharge.php                 // Payment transactions
UserBalanceTransaction.php       // Charge ledger
BalanceSuspensionLog.php        // Suspension tracking

// Meta classes (for admin UI)
UserBalance_Meta.php
UserRecharge_Meta.php
UserBalanceTransaction_Meta.php
BalanceSuspensionLog_Meta.php
```

### 3. BalanceService (Already Done ✅)
```php
// app/Services/BalanceService.php

// Main operations:
BalanceService::chargeService()           // Charge with atomic lock
BalanceService::completeRecharge()        // Confirm payment
BalanceService::createRecharge()          // Create payment request
BalanceService::checkAndSuspendIfNeeded() // Check & suspend
BalanceService::resumeServicesIfEligible()// Resume after recharge

// Sync management:
BalanceService::verifyAndFixBalance()    // Detect & fix desync
BalanceService::rebuildAllBalances()     // Emergency rebuild
BalanceService::getBalanceDiscrepancies()// Get report
```

### 4. Sync System (NEW ✅)
```bash
# Console command:
php artisan balance:verify-sync           # Verify all users
php artisan balance:verify-sync --fix     # Auto-fix
php artisan balance:verify-sync --user-id=5 --fix  # Specific user
php artisan balance:verify-sync --rebuild # Full rebuild

# Scheduled jobs (in Kernel.php):
- Daily at 02:00 AM: Verify & fix desync
- Monthly on 1st at 03:00 AM: Full rebuild
```

### 5. Tests (Already Done ✅)
```bash
# Run all balance tests
php artisan test tests/Feature/BalanceSyncTest.php

# 9 test cases covering:
✅ Atomic charging
✅ Insufficient balance handling
✅ Concurrent charge safety
✅ Desync detection & fixing
✅ Balance before/after tracking
✅ Recharge functionality
✅ Balance rebuild
✅ Transaction rollback
✅ Discrepancy reporting
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### User Uses VPS 1 Minute ($50,000)

```
1. vps_usage inserted (1 row)
2. Every hour (batch):
   a. Calculate user's charges: sum(vps_usage for user)
   b. Check balance is sufficient
   c. IF sufficient:
      - INSERT user_balance_transactions (-$50k)
      - UPDATE user_balances (debit $50k)
   d. IF insufficient:
      - Suspend VPS instance
      - Create suspension log
      - Send alert
```

### Desync Safety

**Scenario:** Server crashes during balance update

```
INSERT user_balance_transactions ✅
UPDATE user_balances ❌ (crash)

Normal system → DESYNC (transaction recorded but balance not updated)

Our system:
  DB::transaction() → Auto-ROLLBACK both operations
  Next day at 02:00 → Nightly job detects any missed syncs
               → Auto-fixes them
               → Logs discrepancy
```

### Race Condition Safety

**Scenario:** 2 concurrent charges (each $80k) on $100k balance

```
Without lock:
  Charge 1: Check (100k >= 80k ✓) → Debit → Balance = 20k
  Charge 2: Check (100k >= 80k ✓) → Debit → Balance = 20k ❌
  Result: Both succeed (negative balance!)

With our lock:
  Charge 1: Lock → Check → Debit → Unlock
  Charge 2: WAIT for lock → Check (20k >= 80k ✗) → Fail
  Result: Correct (one succeeds, one fails)
```

## 📊 Tables Overview

### user_balance (Denormalized Cache)
```sql
id, user_id (UNIQUE), balance, total_recharged, total_spent, 
status, is_frozen, frozen_reason, low_balance_threshold, 
last_low_balance_alert, last_transaction_at, created_at, updated_at

Indexes: user_id, status, is_frozen

Purpose: Fast O(1) lookup for "do I have enough money?"
Updated: Every charge transaction
Safety: Synced with user_balance_transactions nightly
```

### user_balance_transactions (Audit Ledger)
```sql
id, user_id, transaction_type, service_type, reference_model, 
reference_id, related_recharge_id, amount, balance_before, 
balance_after, description, status, is_reversed, 
transaction_date, created_at, updated_at

Indexes: user_id, transaction_type, service_type, transaction_date, status

Purpose: Complete audit trail of all money movements
Source of truth: For rebuilding user_balance if corrupted
Immutable: Never updated after creation (only reversed via new record)
```

### user_recharges (Payment History)
```sql
id, user_id, amount, payment_method, transaction_code, 
reference_code, status, notes, paid_at, completed_at, 
expired_at, gateway_response, ip_address, user_agent, 
created_at, updated_at

Indexes: user_id, status, transaction_code, created_at

Status: pending, processing, completed, failed, cancelled

Purpose: Track all payment attempts
Linked: To user_balance_transactions via related_recharge_id
```

### balance_suspension_logs (Service Suspension Tracking)
```sql
id, user_id, reason, suspended_at, resumed_at, 
duration_minutes, balance_at_suspension, notes, created_at

Indexes: user_id, suspended_at

Purpose: Track service suspension history
Triggers: When balance < 0
Auto-resume: When user recharges & balance becomes positive
```

## 🛡️ Sync Guarantees

| Mechanism | Prevents | Runtime | Trigger |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| DB::transaction | Partial updates (one operation fails) | Real-time | Every charge |
| Pessimistic lock | Concurrent charge overdraft | Real-time | Every charge |
| Nightly verify | Undetected desync from crashes | 02:00 AM | Daily |
| Monthly rebuild | Catastrophic corruption | 03:00 AM (1st) | Monthly |

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Charge User for VPS Usage
```php
try {
    $transaction = BalanceService::chargeService(
        userId: $user->id,
        amount: 50000,
        serviceType: 'vps',
        description: 'VPS usage: 60 minutes',
        referenceModel: 'VpsUsage',
        referenceId: $vpsUsage->id
    );
    
    // Success - transaction recorded atomically
    return response(['success' => true, 'transaction_id' => $transaction->id]);
    
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Insufficient balance - don't provision service
    return response(['error' => $e->getMessage()], 402);
}
```

### Check User's Balance
```php
$balance = UserBalance::where('user_id', $user->id)
    ->lockForUpdate()  // Don't let concurrent charges interfere
    ->first();

if ($balance->balance >= $required_amount) {
    // Safe to provision
} else {
    // Show payment screen
}
```

### Verify Sync (Manual)
```bash
# Check all users
php artisan balance:verify-sync

# Output:
# Checked: 1250 users
# ✅ Synced: 1250 users
# ⚠️  Fixed: 0 users
# [All good!]
```

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# If widespread corruption detected:
php artisan balance:verify-sync --rebuild

# Recalculates all balances from transactions
# Safe because transactions = source of truth
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Q: How to verify sync is working?
```bash
php artisan balance:verify-sync
```

### Q: How to manually fix a user's balance?
```bash
php artisan balance:verify-sync --user-id=5 --fix
```

### Q: How to rebuild all balances (emergency)?
```bash
php artisan balance:verify-sync --rebuild
```

### Q: How often does verification run?
- Automatic: Daily at 02:00 AM (configured in Kernel.php)
- Manual: Anytime via command
- Monthly full rebuild: 1st of month at 03:00 AM

### Q: What if a charge fails halfway?
- DB::transaction ensures rollback of both INSERT & UPDATE
- No partial data left
- Nightly job will detect any missed syncs

### Q: Can I lose money due to sync issues?
- No. Transactions (ledger) are immutable source of truth
- Denormalized balance is just a cache
- Even if cache corrupted, rebuild from ledger recovers truth
